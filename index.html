            <p>It's true that our physical health is important, but our mental health is also important</p>
            <h2>What is a healthy mental?</h2>
            <p>We don't choose our challenges, especially because every person has their own challenges. When you are tough enough to face every challenges, or when you are calm in difficult situations, that means you have a good mental health. </p>
            <p>Are you feeling overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, or depressed? If so, you are not alone. Many people experience these feelings at some point in their lives. It's important to talk about mental health and seek help when needed.</p>
            <h2>What to do if I face those feelings?</h2>
            <p>Don't ever think of ending your life! Life doesn't end here, and it only leads you to immortality</p>
            <p>God is our true hope, he is our creator and ruler, he holds the past and the future. Surrender your life to him fully, and he will give you strength.</p>
